          As the winter is in the corner and the semester is nearing its end, we bring to you the 'SnT Winter Camp 2019'.<br>

          Science and Technology Council utilizes the Winter Vacation as a time period to recruit a few students and help them learn about various topics in varied domains. This is a time when the clubs attempt to boost your learning curve through a very comprehensive set of lectures, workshops and projects.<br>

          We are hosting a lecture today to let you know about the Winter Camp plans of various clubs and what the selection policy shall be.<br>
